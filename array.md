## Array jobs with slurm
### Description
Array jobs are jobs where the job setup, including job size, memory, time etc. is constant, but the application input varies. 
Instead of submitting N jobs independently, you can submit one array job unifying N tasks. These provide advantages in the job handling as well as for the SLURM scheduler.
